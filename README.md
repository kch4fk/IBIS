# IBIS

This repository contains documentation for the Independent Binocular Imaging System (IBIS). The IBIS is designed to hold and position the ZED Mini stereoscopic camera during tele-operation of the Raven II. It runs on an Arduino Uno R3 using custom kinematic and inverse kinematic models, and it can communicate through a serial port to report its position and accept commands. This allows for open-source development and easy integration with other systems.
